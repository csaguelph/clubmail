Use this to understand what content resonates with your audience.

## Subscriber Analytics

### Individual Subscriber Activity

View engagement for each subscriber:

1. Navigate to "Subscribers"
2. Click on a subscriber's email
3. View their engagement history:
   - Which campaigns they opened
   - Which links they clicked
   - Last activity date

### List Performance

Compare performance across email lists:

- Open rates by list
- Click rates by list
- Engagement patterns
- Identify your most engaged lists

## Understanding Metrics

### Open Tracking

**How It Works:**
- Invisible tracking pixel in each email
- Loads when email is opened
- Records open event and timestamp

**Limitations:**
- Only works if images are enabled
- Some email clients block tracking
- May undercount actual opens
- More reliable on mobile devices

**Best Practices:**
- Don't rely solely on open rates
- Combine with click rates for better picture
- Track trends over time, not absolute numbers

### Click Tracking

**How It Works:**
- All links automatically wrapped with tracking URLs
- Click redirects through tracking system
- Records click event, link URL, and timestamp

**Advantages:**
- More reliable than open tracking
- Works regardless of image settings
- Shows which content is engaging
- Better measure of actual engagement

### Bounce Tracking

**Soft Bounces:**
- Temporary delivery failures
- May retry automatically
- Examples: Mailbox full, server down
- **Action:** Monitor, may resolve automatically

**Hard Bounces:**
- Permanent delivery failures
- Examples: Invalid email, domain doesn't exist
- **Action:** Subscriber automatically blocked
- **Impact:** Removed from future sends

### Complaint Tracking

**Spam Complaints:**
- Subscriber marks email as spam
- Automatically unsubscribes subscriber
- **Impact:** Can affect sender reputation
- **Action:** Review content and sending practices
