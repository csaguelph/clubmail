## Managing Team Members

### Viewing Team Members

See all team members:

- **Name** - Member's display name
- **Email** - Member's email address
- **Role** - Current permission level
- **Joined** - When they were added
- **Last Active** - Last time they accessed the club

### Changing Roles

Update a member's permissions:

1. Find the team member
2. Click "Change Role" or edit icon
3. Select new role (Owner, Editor, or Viewer)
4. Save changes

**Note:** You cannot change your own role if you're the only Owner.

### Removing Team Members

Remove a member from the club:

1. Find the team member
2. Click "Remove" or delete icon
3. Confirm removal
4. Member loses access immediately

**Warning:** Removing a member:
- Immediately revokes their access
- They can no longer view or edit club content
- Their past contributions remain (campaigns they created, etc.)

## Best Practices

### Role Assignment

**Assign Minimal Permissions:**
- Give Editor role to those who need to create content
- Use Viewer role for those who only need visibility
- Reserve Owner role for administrators

**Regular Review:**
- Periodically review team member access
- Remove members who no longer need access
- Update roles as responsibilities change

### Security

**Protect Owner Access:**
- Limit Owner role to trusted administrators
- Don't share Owner credentials
- Use Editor role for most team members

**Access Control:**
- Only add members who need access
- Remove members when they leave the club
- Review access regularly

### Collaboration

**Clear Responsibilities:**
- Communicate who can do what
- Set expectations for each role
- Document processes for your team

**Workflow:**
- Editors create and manage campaigns
- Owners review and approve
- Viewers monitor activity
- Everyone stays informed
