## Accessing Club Settings

1. Navigate to your club's dashboard
2. Click on "Settings" in the sidebar
3. You'll see all configurable options

**Note:** Only Club Owners can modify club settings. Editors and Viewers have read-only access.

## Email Settings

### From Name

The display name shown as the sender in email clients:

- **Example:** "Computer Science Club" or "CSA Newsletter"
- **Best Practice:** Use your club's official name
- **Character Limit:** Recommended under 50 characters

### From Email Slug

The part before `@clubmail.csaonline.ca` in sender addresses:

- **Example:** "newsletter" → `newsletter@clubmail.csaonline.ca`
- **Default:** Uses your club's slug if not set
- **Best Practice:** Use something recognizable (e.g., "newsletter", "updates", "club")

### Reply-To Email

Where replies to your emails should be sent:

- **Optional:** Leave blank to use default
- **Recommended:** Set to your club's official email address
- **Example:** `club@example.com` or `president@club.org`

### Default Subject Prefix

Optional prefix added to all campaign subject lines:

- **Example:** "[Newsletter]" → Subject becomes "[Newsletter] Weekly Update"
- **Optional:** Leave blank for no prefix
- **Use Case:** Help subscribers identify emails from your club

## Branding Settings

### Brand Color

Primary color used in email templates:

- **Format:** Hex color code (e.g., `#b1d135`)
- **Default:** `#b1d135` (CSA green)
- **Usage:** Used in buttons, links, and accent elements
- **Tip:** Use your club's official brand color

## Tracking Settings

### Enable Tracking

Toggle open and click tracking:

- **Enabled:** Tracks when emails are opened and links are clicked
- **Disabled:** No tracking pixels or click tracking URLs
- **Default:** Enabled
- **Privacy:** Some email clients block tracking by default

**Note:** Disabling tracking means you won't have analytics data for campaigns.

4. Existing campaigns are not affected

## Best Practices

### Sender Information
