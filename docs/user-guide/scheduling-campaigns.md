## Best Practices

### Timing Considerations

**For Student Clubs:**
- **Weekdays:** 10 AM - 2 PM (between classes)
- **Avoid:** Early mornings, late nights, exam periods
- **Events:** Send 1-2 days before event date

**General Best Practices:**
- **Tuesday-Thursday:** Often highest engagement
- **Morning:** 9 AM - 11 AM
- **Afternoon:** 2 PM - 4 PM
- **Test:** Try different times and measure results

### Planning Ahead

- **Weekly Newsletters:** Schedule for same day/time each week
- **Event Announcements:** Schedule 1-2 days before event
- **Reminders:** Schedule follow-up emails
- **Seasonal:** Plan holiday or semester-based campaigns

### Time Zone Awareness

- Consider your subscribers' locations
- University clubs: Most subscribers in same time zone
- International clubs: May need to consider multiple zones
- Default: System uses your local time zone

## Monitoring Scheduled Campaigns

### Before Send

- Check scheduled campaigns regularly
- Verify content is still relevant
- Ensure email list is correct
- Confirm send time is appropriate

### During Send

- Status changes to "Sending"
- Can monitor progress
- Cannot cancel once sending starts
- Check for any errors

### After Send

## Troubleshooting

## Tips
