# React

- Use **functional components** with hooks; no class components.
- `src/app`: default to **server components**; add `"use client"` only when needed.
- Keep pages thin; delegate complex UI/logic to `src/components` and `src/lib`.

# Styling

- Use **TailwindCSS** utilities for styling.
- For conditional classes, use `clsx()`/`cn` instead of string concatenation.
- Extract complex or repeated UI into reusable components.

# Accessibility & Composition

- Prefer semantic elements (`button`, `a`, `nav`, etc.) with basic `aria-*` where needed.
- Ensure form inputs have labels and interactive elements are keyboard-focusable.
- Favor small, composable components over deeply nested ones.

# Headless UI

- For dialogs, menus, listboxes, disclosures, switches, prefer **Headless UI** primitives.
- Let Headless UI handle behavior/accessibility; style with Tailwind.
