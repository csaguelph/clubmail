# React & Components

- Use **functional components** and React hooks only; do not generate class components.
- In `src/app`, prefer **server components** by default:
  - Only mark components as client components with `"use client"` when necessary for interactivity (state, effects, event handlers, or browser APIs).
- Keep route/page files minimal:
  - Delegate complex UI or logic to components in `src/components` or utilities in `src/lib`.
  - Avoid deeply nested logic inside page components.

# Tailwind & Styling

- Use **TailwindCSS** utility classes for styling; avoid inline `style` except for rare, simple cases.
- For conditional classes, prefer `clsx()` (and project-specific helpers like `cn` if they exist) instead of manual string concatenation.
- Extract complex/patterned UIs into reusable components under `src/components`.

# Headless UI

- For common interactive patterns like dialogs, menus, listboxes, disclosures, and switches, prefer **Headless UI** primitives (e.g. `Dialog`, `Menu`, `Listbox`, `Disclosure`, `Switch`) over building from scratch.
- Use Headless UI for its built-in accessibility and behavior, then style via Tailwind utility classes.
- Only roll custom complex interactive widgets when Headless UI does not cover the use case, while still following the same ARIA and keyboard-navigation expectations.

# Accessibility & Composition

- Aim for accessible components:
  - Provide appropriate `aria-*` attributes where helpful.
  - Ensure form inputs have associated labels.
  - Make interactive elements keyboard-focusable and use semantic elements (`button`, `a`, `nav`, `header`, etc.) instead of generic `div`s.
- Favor **composable** components (slots, children, render props when appropriate) over tightly coupled, deeply nested components.

# Client Logic & Hooks

- Put reusable client-side logic into custom hooks under `src/hooks` (e.g. `useXyz` files).
- Avoid duplicating complex hook logic across components; factor it into shared hooks instead.
