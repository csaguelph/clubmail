# Component Structure

- Components in `src/components` should be framework-agnostic where reasonable and focused on **presentation** plus light logic.
- Prefer smaller, reusable primitives (buttons, inputs, layout wrappers) composed into more complex components.

# Styling

- Use Tailwind utility classes as the primary styling mechanism.
- For conditional or dynamic classes, use `clsx()` or the project’s `cn` helper.
- Avoid duplicating long Tailwind class strings; consider extracting variants into helper functions or smaller components.

# Accessibility

- For interactive elements, use semantic HTML (`button`, `input`, `a`) and include appropriate `aria-*` attributes when needed.
- Ensure focus states are visible and not removed.
- For dialogs, modals, or complex widgets, ensure keyboard navigation and basic ARIA roles/labels.

# Headless UI

- When building dialogs, menus, listboxes, disclosures, switches, and similar interactive patterns, prefer **Headless UI** primitives (e.g. `Dialog`, `Menu`, `Listbox`, `Disclosure`, `Switch`).
- Rely on Headless UI for correct accessibility semantics and behavior, and style with Tailwind utility classes.
- Avoid reinventing complex interactive components unless Headless UI cannot support the scenario, and in those cases still meet the same ARIA and keyboard expectations.

# Client vs Server

- Most components under `src/components` will be **client components** if they use state/effects; omit `"use client"` only when a component is truly server-only.
- Keep server-only logic out of reusable UI components; delegate that to callers or dedicated server utilities.
