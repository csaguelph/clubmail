# Component Structure

- Components in `src/components` should be framework-agnostic where reasonable and focused on **presentation** plus light logic.
- Prefer smaller, reusable primitives (buttons, inputs, layout wrappers) composed into more complex components.

# Components

- Make components small, reusable, and mostly presentational.
- Build primitives (buttons, inputs, layout pieces) and compose them.

# Styling

- Use Tailwind utilities for styling.
- Use `clsx()`/`cn` for dynamic classes.
- Avoid repeating long Tailwind strings; extract variants or smaller components.

# Accessibility

- Use semantic interactive elements (`button`, `input`, `a`) with appropriate `aria-*`.
- Preserve visible focus states.
- For dialogs/menus/etc., ensure keyboard navigation and roles/labels.

# Headless UI

- Prefer **Headless UI** (`Dialog`, `Menu`, `Listbox`, `Disclosure`, `Switch`, etc.) for common interactive patterns.
- Rely on Headless UI for behavior/accessibility; style with Tailwind.
